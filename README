This project presents a GPU-based tau-leaping version of the Gillespie algorithm. 
Only NVIDIA(tm) video cards are supported now.

How to create a local copy of the repository?
=============================================
git clone git://github.com/CSSL-UWM/tau_leaping.git

You can build the project with the CMake tool:
cd tau_leaping
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

The CUDA driver and CUDA Toolkit must be installed in the system. The latest version is available at:
http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit

to run the simulation, use the following syntax:
tau_leaping -f <model_name> -t <finish_time> -n <number of realizations> -r <list_of_Species_to_track_space_separated>
